# Data-Analytics-Hub

This project features a Data Analytics Portal created with Streamlit, allowing users to interactively explore datasets through dynamic visualizations and perform machine learning predictions. The portal supports data uploads (CSV/Excel) and offers insightful summaries. Users can conduct group analyses and visualize data with bar, pie, and scatter plots. Additionally, I implemented a basic machine learning model to predict outcomes such as profit, with results displayed through comparative visualizations (e.g., predicted vs. actual outcomes). The integration of the machine learning aspect was inspired by informative YouTube tutorials, enhancing the overall functionality of the platform.
